#Lists and Arrays :

1- Lists are immutable. Once we create a List, we cannot make any changes to it.
2- Arrays are mutable. We can change each item at any time.

3- both Lists and Arrays have fixed sizes. ( ArrayList can add additional items )

4- Arrays and Lists can hold more than one data type at a time
