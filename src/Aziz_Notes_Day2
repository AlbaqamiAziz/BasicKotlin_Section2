#Lists and Arrays :

1- Lists are immutable. Once we create a List, we cannot make any changes to it.
2- Arrays are mutable. We can change each item at any time.

3- both Lists and Arrays have fixed sizes. ( ArrayList can add additional items )

4- Arrays and Lists can hold more than one data type at a time



#2d
 val credentials = arrayListOf<ArrayList<String>>()
 val country = readLine().toString()
 print("City : ")
 val city = readLine().toString()
 // to ways to add :
 countriesCapitals.add(ArrayList(listOf(country,city)))
 countriesCapitals.add(arrayListOf(country, city))
